![Lynx](http://mtac.app/assets/images/lynxbanner.png)

Lynx combines many of my smaller tweaks into one large one capable of customizing iOS 13 in many ways. This was made with a dynamic design, and updates will be provided that include all reasonable feature requests.

Requires libcolorpicker (1.6.7) from [BigBoss](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/org.thebigboss.libcolorpicker/) and Cephei (1.14) from [Chariz](https://repo.chariz.io/package/ws.hbang.common/)

Available on [Twickd](https://repo.twickd.com/)

Thanks to [Ethan Whited](https://twitter.com/EthanWhited) for his amazing graphics and testing
